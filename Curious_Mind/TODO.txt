V1.0
- test ALL firebase calls (DbLogic file)
- input validations for correctness all over the app 
    screens still needing validation:
    - ForgotPasswordScreen
    - LoginScreen
    - MainFeedScreen
    - NewPostScreen
    - PastorSecCodeScreen
    - PastorSignUpScreen
    - ProfileScreen
    - ResetPasswordScreen
    - ThreadScreen
    - UserSignUpScreen
    - UserTypeScreen
    - ViewProfileScreen
- add button disabling if fields aren't filled out to each screen:
    screens still needing a button (check to make sure they work):
    - LoginScreen
    - PastorSignUpScreen
    - ViewProfileScreen
- Add bad words check for all user input.
- when adding event, then clicking home screen, add event screen stays up
- Hide events if current date > event date 
    (not sure we want to do this now that we can delete events. 
    Pastors can just delete their own events if they don't want it up anymore.
    It might spark conversation to keep up an old event. Plus, do we want
    church services to be "events"? I'm thinking so, but I'm happy to change that.)
- loading widget while creating accounts/posts/events/checking pastor code
- DeleteUser in delUser is hitting some snapshot.val() for some reason...
- liked a post and it printed "OnValue MainFeed" and "inside prepare posts from db" like 50+ times
- Figure out how to style alerts for "sorts"/ style the sort buttons 
- clicking on profile makes null

*************************** BEFORE PUBLISHING ************************************************************
Make sure each screen passes tests from Jarod and Maz and maybe someone else we can get to test it?
Jarod's pass on each screen (remove screen from list when complete):
    - EventScreen
    - ForgotPasswordScreen
    - LoginScreen
    - MainFeedScreen
    - NewEventScreen
    - NewPostScreen
    - PastorSecCodeScreen
    - PastorSignUpScreen
    - ProfileScreen
    - ResetPasswordScreen
    - ThreadScreen
    - UserSignUpScreen
    - UserTypeScreen
    - ViewProfileScreen

Maz's pass on each screen (remove screen from list when complete):
    - EventScreen
    - ForgotPasswordScreen
    - LoginScreen
    - MainFeedScreen
    - NewEventScreen
    - NewPostScreen
    - PastorSecCodeScreen
    - PastorSignUpScreen
    - ProfileScreen
    - ResetPasswordScreen
    - ThreadScreen
    - UserSignUpScreen
    - UserTypeScreen
    - ViewProfileScreen

V2.0
- search for users
- be aware of pastors who could be trolls
- report users, delete account, blacklist their account email
- make sure there aren't duplicated questions
- input blacklist for all user inputs 
- notifications for when users post / do anything
- timestap needs to be added to posts (tell the time difference like instagram.
    In my opinion, this depends on the popularity of the app and whether there are 
    frequent enough posts to make this worthwhile.)
