V1.0
- test ALL firebase calls (DbLogic file)
- handleSignUp in DbLogic needs to be refactored into helper functions
- input validations all over the app (and check that an event/post can't be created without certain inputs)
- filter posts (words)
- Add regex to filters 
- Android event time/date buttons auto popup
- when adding event, then clicking home screen, add event screen stays up
- Hide events if current date > event date
- sort posts, timestap needs to be added to posts
- Disable all buttons if input is empty and change their style to reflect that
- Remove text from reset password screen once finished. Too tired to do now :D
- allow pastors that created the event to delete it
- loading widget while creating accoutns/posts/events
- checking security code isn't working


V2.0
- search for users
- be aware of pastors who could be trolls
- report users, delete account, blacklist their account email
- make sure there aren't duplicated questions
