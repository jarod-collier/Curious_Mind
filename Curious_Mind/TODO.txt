V1.0
- add button disabling if fields aren't filled out to each screen:
    screens still needing a button (check to make sure they work):
    - LoginScreen
- Figure out how to style alerts for "sorts"/ style the sort buttons 
- issue with it saying the user already reported a post

*************************** BEFORE PUBLISHING ************************************************************
Make sure each screen passes tests from Jarod and Maz and maybe someone else we can get to test it?
Jarod's pass on each screen (remove screen from list when complete):
    - EventScreen
    - LoginScreen
    - MainFeedScreen
    - NewEventScreen
    - NewPostScreen
    - ThreadScreen
    - ViewProfileScreen

Maz's pass on each screen (remove screen from list when complete):
    - EventScreen
    - ForgotPasswordScreen
    - LoginScreen
    - MainFeedScreen
    - NewEventScreen
    - NewPostScreen
    - PastorSecCodeScreen
    - PastorSignUpScreen
    - ProfileScreen
    - ResetPasswordScreen
    - ThreadScreen
    - UserSignUpScreen
    - UserTypeScreen
    - ViewProfileScreen

V2.0
- search for users
- be aware of pastors who could be trolls
- report users, delete account, blacklist their account email
- make sure there aren't duplicated questions
- notifications for when users post / do anything
- timestap needs to be added to posts (tell the time difference like instagram.
    In my opinion, this depends on the popularity of the app and whether there are 
    frequent enough posts to make this worthwhile.)
- Hide events if current date > event date 
    (not sure we want to do this now that we can delete events. 
    Pastors can just delete their own events if they don't want it up anymore.
    It might spark conversation to keep up an old event. Plus, do we want
    church services to be "events"? I'm thinking so, but I'm happy to change that.)
- Make recurring Events
